<h2>An event around CSS… really?</h2>
<p>
  Yes! We believe that CSS is one of the quickest and most fun ways to understand how websites are build and get your hands into coding. And that doesn’t mean CSS is for beginners only: Just check out the crazy experiments on <a href="http://codepen.io/">Codepen.io</a> or see what leading developers are discussing at events like <a href=:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL37ZVnwpeshGi0vwS7HNUvsj8_vcNzQZk>CSSconf EU</a> to get inspired and see how far you can take the language.
