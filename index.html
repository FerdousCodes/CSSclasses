<h2>Who can attend?</h2>
<p>
  Anyone! Learners of all levels are welcome, including beginners with absolutely no experience and advanced CSS coders.
<br>
We only ask you to respect our <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org/about.html#core_values">core values</a>, and to bring your own laptop.
</p> 

<h2>An event around CSS… really?</h2>
<p>
  Yes! We believe that CSS is one of the quickest and most fun ways to understand how websites are built and get your hands into coding. And that doesn’t mean CSS is for beginners only: Just check out the crazy experiments on <a href="http://codepen.io/">Codepen.io</a> or see what leading developers are discussing at events like <a href=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL37ZVnwpeshGi0vwS7HNUvsj8_vcNzQZk>CSSconf EU</a> to get inspired and see how far you can take the language.
</p>

<h2>Who is organizing this?</h2>
<p>
  The volunteer teams behind CSSconf EU and Open Tech School. We have experience in teaching workshops and organzing events, and our motivation is to share knowledge and passion for building fun and beautiful things for the web. We subscribe to the <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org/about.html#core_values">core values</a> of Open Tech School and are committed to create a safe and encouraging space for learners and coaches.
