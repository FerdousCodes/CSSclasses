<h2>How does coaching at CSSclasses work?</h2>
<p>
  In our workshops, learners follow along the tasks on their own computers. Learners have to figure out how to solve certain problems, and might get stuck or need help – that’s what coaches are for! To give advice, to explain something and help learners to follow along with the tutorial. Coaches don’t have to be around the entire day, just a few hours of help are great too.
</p>

<h2>Who can be a coach?</h2>
<p>Everyone! As soon as you can help the learner next to you, you are a coach. No need to be an expert. No one knows the answer to everything – if you are not sure or stuck with a question, just ask another coach to help out.</p>

<h2>How do Coaches prepare?</h2>
<p>
  Be sure to read the <a href="https://opentechschool.github.io/slides/presentations/coaching/">OpenTechSchool Coaches Guide</a>, and also take a look at the <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org/about.html">Core Values</a>. Also please arrive 30minutes before the official start of the workshop, to attend our Coaches briefing.
